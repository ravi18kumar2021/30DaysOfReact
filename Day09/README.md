# Day 9: 😂 Joke Generator – Fetching APIs in React

## 🚀 What I Built

A simple **Joke Generator** app that fetches a random joke from an external API using `useEffect`. This project demonstrates how to perform asynchronous data fetching in React and handle loading and error states gracefully.

- Fetches a new joke on initial load
- Provides a button to fetch another joke
- Displays loading and error messages for better user experience
