# Day10: Project - Quote Fetcher with Loader in React

## 🚀 What I Built

A **Quote Fetcher** app that retrieves random quotes from the [Quotable API](https://api.quotable.io/random) using React’s `useEffect`. It features category-based filtering, a CSS-based loader animation, and responsive conditional rendering.

- Fetch random quotes based on selected **categories**.
- Loading spinner while fetching.
- Error handling and feedback if something goes wrong.
- Clean, accessible UI with dynamic category selector.
