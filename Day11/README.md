# Day11: Project - Simple To-Do List with React Lists & Keys

## 🚀 What I Built

A **Simple To-Do List** built using React to practice rendering lists with `.map()` and handling dynamic data. This project demonstrates how to manage an array of items in state, render them in the UI, and update or remove them as needed.

- Add, complete, and delete tasks
- Organize tasks into **Pending** and **Completed** sections
- Clear all pending or completed tasks at once
- Shows dynamic content and handles empty states
