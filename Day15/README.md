# Day15: Project - Multi-page App

## 🚀 What I Built

A **multi-page React application** using **React Router (createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider)** to demonstrate **basic routing** concepts. This project focuses on creating **multiple routes/pages** in a **Single Page Application (SPA)** using nested routing.

### ✨ Features
- **Multiple pages:** Home, About, Contact
- **React Router v7 (createBrowserRouter)** for route configuration
- **Nested routing** with `<Outlet>` support in `App.jsx`
- **Navigation Bar (Navbar)** for switching between pages
- Active route highlighting using `NavLink`
- Styled with **Tailwind CSS**
