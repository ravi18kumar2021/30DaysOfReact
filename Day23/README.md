# Day23: Project - Layout Wrapper (Composition Pattern)

## 🚀 What I Built

A **Layout Wrapper** project demonstrating **composition patterns** in React. This project focuses on creating a **reusable layout component** that can wrap any content passed as `children`. It helps in avoiding code duplication and maintaining consistent layout styling across components.

### ✨ Features
- 🏗 **Reusable LayoutCard component**
- 📦 Uses **React children prop** for dynamic content insertion
- 🖼 **Title prop** for flexible headings in each card
- 🎨 Consistent styling using **Tailwind CSS**
- ✅ Demonstrates the **composition** concept by wrapping multiple different content blocks in a shared layout

- Using **`children`** prop to make components **dynamic and reusable**
- Building **generic wrapper components** for consistent layouts
- Continued applying **Tailwind CSS** to build **modular, clean UIs**
- Realized that **composition > inheritance** in React component design
