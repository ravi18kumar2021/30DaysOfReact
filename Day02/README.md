# Day2: Project - Team Member Cards using React

## 🚀 What I Built
A reusable **Profile Card component** using React **props**. The app displays a list of team members by **mapping over mock data** and rendering the same component with different data.

This project builds on simple static card and introduces **component reusability and dynamic rendering** using `props`.
