# Day22: Project - Theme Preference with Custom Hook (useLocalStorage)

## 🚀 What I Built

A **Theme Switcher** application with **persistent theme preference** using a **custom React Hook** called `useLocalStorage()`. The theme preference (Light/Dark) **persists** across page reloads using **localStorage**.

### ✨ Features
- 🌗 **Toggle between Light & Dark Themes**
- 💾 **Persistent Preference** → Stored in **localStorage**
- 🏗 **Custom Hook → `useLocalStorage()`** to reuse this pattern in other projects
- 📦 **Global State** using React **Context API** → theme is accessible anywhere in the app
